    <h1>Creating links in Html</h1>
    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. Links allow users
        to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.

    </p>
    <p>
        A link has two ends, called anchors. The link starts at the source anchor and points to the
        destination anchor, which may be any web resource, for example, an image, an audio or video clip,
        a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.

    <p>
        MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses.
        MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company.
    </p>
    <p>
        MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
        and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored
        by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation)
        .[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create
        MariaDB.[9]
    </p>

    <p>MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database
        using SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that
        need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software
        stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. </p>

    <h3 id="or">Oracle</h3>
    <p>
        Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin,
        Texas. The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, until December
        2020 when it moved its headquarters to Texas.[7] The company sells database software and technology,
        cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software productsâ€”particularly its own brands of database
        management systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation,[15] officially
        named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding
        company.[16] Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming
        language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems most
        of which support C.[17]
